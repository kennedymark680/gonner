Welcome to the game gonner. It's a game that brings a new level of excitement to your movie watching experience by predicting who's next to be a gonner.

You will select the movie you'd like to watch, list the characters in the movie and when you think they are going to die (within the movie context). You will be rewarded based on how accurate you list is.
